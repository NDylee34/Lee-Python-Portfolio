    "# 2. Punctuation marks like periods and commas are treated as separate tokens. For example, \".\" is a token on its own.\n",
    "# 3. Contractions like \"doesn't\" are split internally into components: \"does\" and \"n't\" for processing, though it is shown as a single token in some contexts.\n"

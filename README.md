# Lee-Python-Portfolio
This portfolio is a compilation of all the Elements of Computing II projects I have worked on this semester. It will be updated on a regular basis.

## Plan for Organizing Future Projects
My plan is to create folders for each step of the projects -- EDA, Filtered Dataset, Models, Final Visualizations & Takeaways. I believe that sorting them in different folders will help me better organize and locate my projects.
